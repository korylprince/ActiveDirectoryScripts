ActiveDirectoryScripts

https://github.com/korylprince/ActiveDirectoryScripts

#Installing#

Just copy the script to a computer you wish to run it on. Scripts are all standalone.

#Usage#

These scripts are meant to be run with cscript. The top of each script file has the parameters the script takes.

#Caveats#

I can't promise this will work in your environment. It probably will though.
